This is a game in which the player has to equal a randomly generated number between 19 and 120. This is accomplished by clicking one of the four skulls which also has a randomly generated number assigned to it for the duration of each game. Both the target number and the assigned numbers are reset each time the player either wins or losses the game.

This game utilises HTML, CSS and JavaScript and JQuery.
